# jsbook
Notebook for javascript experimentation

1. Easy to use javascript experimentation tool.
2. Runs without backend (node.js/npm/pip install/ngnix etc etc)
3. Can be loaded from the web (i.e. behind a webserver) or from the file system   (certain features like WebRTC might require a server)
4. UI to be close to jupyter notebook (for familiarity)
