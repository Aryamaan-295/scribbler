JSNB is a tool to do experimentation in JavaScript like Jupyter for Python. JavaScript Notebooks can be used to test code while developing and also for scientific calculations. The below notebooks are samples/boilerplates to start experimenting/building. Click on each link to play around with the code.

### Introductory Notebooks
1. [Hello-world for JavaScript Notebook](https://decentralized-intelligence.com/jsnb/#./examples/Hello-world.jsnb). An introductory notebook with a hello-world example.
2. [Using curr_cell function in JSNB](https://decentralized-intelligence.com/jsnb/#./examples/curr_cell_example.jsnb). A special function in JSNB to identify the dom of current cell.
3. [For-loop vs Reduce Performance Comparision](https://decentralized-intelligence.com/jsnb/#./examples/Timing-experiment.jsnb). Compares performance of for-loop in javascript with that of the native function reduce.
