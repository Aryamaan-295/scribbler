UI
- UI could be similar to Jupyter Notebook
- There will be cells with results
- Output could be saved as html
- HTML output can be shown both as code and as html doc
Feartures
- Ability to import .js files
- Use variables (global) across the cells
- Ability to save the whole notebook as a file.. with .nb extension
- Code should run in the browser of the user

Use case
1. try new libraries for testing and building
2. Build reproducable research and share with others
